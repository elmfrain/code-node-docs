**CodeNode Microcontrollers** is a Minecraft mod that adds mos6502 based microcontrollers to the Minecraft so you can automate your redstone contraptions with assembly code.

They act similarly to an **Arduino** in which you control some circuitry with code, and the CodeNode mod is a great way to expierment and learn about **computing** by offering a new fun way to intereact with **Redstone**.

## Features

* **mos6502** based microcontrollers
* **Assembly** programming
* **IDE Screen** with a code editor, cpu status, and memory viewer
